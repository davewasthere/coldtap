Was time for a refresh. This is a good example of the simple website package we're doing, with the following features:

* Clean, responsive design which works on all browsers, desktop & mobile.
* Lightweight & fast. Static site powered using Jekyll means fast delivery to the end user. [Google loves fast sites!](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2010/04/using-site-speed-in-web-search-ranking.html)
* Secure. No Wordpress&trade; vulnerabilities. You won't get your site defaced.
* Global Content Delivery Network. Regardless of where your visitors come from, they get the fastest possible webpages.
* SSL Certificate. Again, [Google now prefer HTTPS sites](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html)
