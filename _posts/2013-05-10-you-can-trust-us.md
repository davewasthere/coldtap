title: You can trust us
description: "If a client says the words 'You can trust us', be careful!"

---

I'm watching a presentation by Mike Monteiro called <a href="http://vimeo.com/22053820" rel="nofollow">F*ck You. Pay Me.</a> And it's great.

One of his slides struck a chord. When a client says "You can trust us", walk away. It's a massive red flag.

On the whole, I'd like to trust people. But one of my very first contracts I bent over backwards to help out and I got burned. I worked my butt off for 18 months and deferred payment in place of royalties to help out until they were profitable. Now that they are, massively profitable and have been for years, do you think they'd pay up? It's ten years later and I'm still chasing 50% of what they owe me.

So all contracts now are Time and Materials. I've learnt a big lesson and maybe it was worth the money. (Although it wasn't really worth the stress)
