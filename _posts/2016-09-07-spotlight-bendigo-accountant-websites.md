A great spotlight to start with, seeing as it's Tax time for a lot of people. The most obvious thing people will search for is 'Bendigo Accountant'. And the first page of google results lists the following sites:

## The Good sites:

### MGR Accountants
[www.mgr.com.au](http://www.mgr.com.au/)  

![MGR Accountants](/images/spotlight/accountants/www.mgr.com.au-(Nexus 6P).png)

#### What I like:

* Fast clean responsive site
* Loads in a couple of seconds - 1.3M payload, 57 requests
* Great platform (by synergy8)
* Good metatags for social sharing
* Very clean HTML
* Clear menu structure

#### Could improve:

* There's no favicon, so bookmarks aren't as pretty
* A ton of CSS/JScript inline. But that might be to reduce the number of requests


### DSG Accounting

* Responsive, great in desktop and mobile. 
* Lovely hand-cranked HTML - Built using Bootstrap.

#### Could improve:
* Again, tough finding much to improve upon here. 

### RSD Advisors

* Loads in a few seconds - 2.3M payload, 56 requests
* Runs on CCH iFirm, a good platform by Wolters Kluwer (Accounting package written in .Net)

#### Could improve:
* Slightly fiddly menu system on desktop. I feel it works better when viewed on mobile.

### Strategem
[www.strategem.com.au](http://www.strategem.com.au/)  

![Strategem](/images/spotlight/accountants/www.strategem.com.au-(Nexus 6P).png)

#### What I like:

* Runs on CCH iFirm, a good platform by Wolters Kluwer (Accounting package written in .Net)

#### Could improve:

![Egan Taylor](/images/spotlight/accountants/www.egantaylor.com.au-(Nexus 6P).png)

#### What I like:
* Another very fast site. 1.5 seconds, only 572K! With 54 requests. Very nice and light payload!
* Subsequent pageloads are ridiculously quick, they'll be getting a good google-boost from that.
* Looks excellent when viewed from mobile
* Incredibly well set up Wordpress site. It's easy to do this wrong. (Think totalmarketingaustralia.com.au deserve the credit here)

#### Could improve:
* Small error on homepage at line 300 where Jquery is called before it's loaded
* Running on older version of Wordpress (4.4.4) - should be up-to-date

### SWR Financial
[swrfinancialgroup.com.au](http://swrfinancialgroup.com.au/)  

![SWR Financial](/images/spotlight/accountants/swrfinancialgroup.com.au-(Nexus 6P).png)

#### What I like:
* Fastest site in sample. 700msec, 21 requests, 565K. Wins hands-down. (Kudos to plannerweb.com.au)
* Responsive site works well.
* Really clean HTML & CSS code.

#### Could improve:
* A stock market ticker? Really? ;) (Get rid of it)
* Crazy keywords metatag. I guess they're trying.
* At mobile resolution, some margins/sizing could be improved (particularly iPhone 5)
* Font choices could be improved.

## The Not so good:
