title: Frustrations with Microsoft
description: Trying to renew my Microsoft Action Pack (or enrol into BizSpark) has been a right pain in the arse

Maybe Microsoft don't want me developing with their tools?

I've worked with the Microsoft stack since ASP 1.0 days (and earlier, if I'm honest) and I'm starting to feel a little frustrated that I can't even renew a subscription with them without hassles.

When I started Coldtap in 2008, the first thing I signed up for was a Microsoft Action Pack subscription. As long as your company meets certain criteria, you get access to a lot of M$ product for a very reasonable annual fee. The following year, I was offered a free Technet subscription through some other M$ contacts, so I took advantage of that.

But with the recent release of Windows 8 & Visual Studio 2012, I wanted to renew my Action Pack so I could start playing with the cool toys. I had to re-sit some sort of competency assessment to vaguely prove I knew my stuff. No worries... sat and passed. But their site refused to acknowledge the results. Sat it another time, and same thing. Still failing to let me through to the next step so I could pay for the subscription.

Never mind, I'll try something else.

This time, I applied for BizSpark. BizSpark is an amazing offering for software startups. Similar offering to the MAPS subscription, only it's free if you meet certain criteria.

Now that Coldtap has pivoted a little and (mostly) handed off it's external client work, we should be eligible. But it appears my trusty 15-year-old hotmail account already had some sort of 'Spark' account associated with it, so I wasn't allowed to apply.

I set up another account, using my company email address. And applied using that, but was turned down. M$ were rather vague about the reasons. Not meeting criteria apparently. I'm still chasing that one up.

So in the end, I managed to get a WebsiteSpark account. Similar to BizSpark, but not ideal. Includes Visual Studio 2012, but not Window 8. Great!

But in the meantime, I did get an email from MAPS asking for some unique ID associated with my hotmail account. Apparently there was some issue with the assessment being credited to the wrong Action Pack, so there's still hope I may get it sorted out.

The most helpful thing in all this has been twitter. If you have a little bitch and moan publicly about things, then at least they give you the correct email address to then help sort it out. And if I ever do get it sorted out, well... that'll be another story.

Does make me wonder whether I shouldn't be buying a MacBook Air and gaining some Ruby on Rails skills though...
