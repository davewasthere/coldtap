For the first time in four years I've gone out and bid for some work. It's been a novel experience.

In the past, I've normally been approached by someone who already knows me and my work. And while this was a warm introduction and not a cold-call, it's still something different to what I'm used to.

That said, the project looks like a lot of fun and I'm excited about the opportunity. So much so that I've started playing with it already, just to get into the swing of things.

That might sound a little sad to some people, but I absolutely love what I do and I'm grateful that I have a career I enjoy so much.
