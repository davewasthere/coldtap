# Web Development Agencies in Bendigo

Bendigo has a ton of decent web development agencies. So if you're looking for someone good, and local, here's a curated list of agencies I think are worth contacting:

## Highly Recommended Agencies

* [RAAK](http://raak.com.au/) - I really like the look of this agency. Their design work is excellent, some great photography,  and very clean responsive websites.
* [Thrive Web Design](http://www.thrivewebdesign.com.au/services) - High quality, clean web design & code. Responsive sites by default. Looks like they use a mixture of Joomla/Wordpress/Bespoke.
* [Bendigo Creative](http://www.bendigocreative.com.au/) - Nice responsive wordpress sites. Good print design as well.


## Other Agencies

* [285 Creative](http://285creative.com.au/) - Full-Service design agency. Websites are either Wordpress or fairly nice static/responsive brochure-ware sites built on Bootstrap.
* [Studio Ink](http://www.studioink.com.au/) - Good Full-Service design agency. Websites tend to be fairly functional wordpress sites again with a reasonable responsive template.
* [Adrian Lock Web Design](http://www.adrianlock.com/) - A good portfolio, good attention to web standards with high-quality code, although sites aren't responsive - which is almost essential these days. Sites use Lock's own custom CMS and are fast.
* [Bendigo IT](http://www.bendigoit.com.au/software/) - Web design is okay, and sites are workable on mobile (although not truly responsive). They appear to almost exclusively use Wordpress with the same basic template.
* [Doomsday Tuna](https://doomsdaytuna.com) - New web agency. Talented group who created Bendarts mobile app. Nice technical work, but I'd like to see a portfolio on their site. Worth checking out though!
* [The Web Company](http://www.thewebcompany.com.au/) - Websites are not responsive and use fairly old standards. Possibly an okay agency if on a budget. 
* [Central Victorian Web Design](http://centralvictorianwebdesign.com/) - Wordpress sites with templates that may, or may not, be responsive.
